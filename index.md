### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was a favorite because it was the first time that I had completed a program in the lab, alone. We had to create guessing game, which was not difficult, but extremely rewarding once I figured out the new language. In this, I learned the basics of C++, as well as the logic and formatting that it uses. 

* Lab 6
    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first code that stumped me. I could not figure out the code for a couple weeks and when I finally got it, there was a rush of adrenaline and satisfaction. Through this I learned to not give up on my code and that I will eventually get the answer if I just push through.

* Lab 12
    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite because it was the first animated code that I had written in C++. There were a lot of new concepts and challenges in this lab that forced me out of my comfort zone. This lab taught me how to use color and the Magick++ files.
